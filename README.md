# 🌐 Automated Static Website with CI/CD

A beginner-friendly demonstration of a **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** pipeline built with standard web technologies and **GitHub Actions**.

Whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions automatically executes automated static checks. If all tests pass, the site is deployed directly to **GitHub Pages**.

## 🚀 Features

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automated node-based testing suite that validates HTML structure and CSS links before publishing.
* **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Zero-downtime deployment directly to GitHub Pages upon passing tests.
* **Lightweight Setup:** Built using plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—no heavy framework required.
